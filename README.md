# DanXi Static Editor

An editor for danxi static resources, and for fun, powered by tauri and Vue. Actually, I don't know what this is. So, It's now for and only for fun.

I don't know what danxi static resources are, either. Don't ask me anything until this tiny tool is approximately finished.

It's recommended to use VSCode, the No. 1 code editor in this universe.

## Dev

git clone git@github.com:DanXi-Dev/danxi-static-editor # Clone the repository
